# Business needs we will address and why this need is of value.

**Store Layout Optimization:**

-WHAT: Analyze whether the placement of a product in a specific area of the store increases the likelihood of purchase

-WHY: Understanding the impact of product placement on purchase likelihood helps maximize sales by strategically designing the store layout to influence customer behavior and increase impulse purchases..

Estimating Revenue from Discounts

-WHAT: Analyze how different discount percentages influence sales and predict total revenue based on discount levels.

-WHY: Accurately predicting the relationship between discount levels and revenue enables stores to design effective discount strategies that maximize profits while maintaining customer satisfaction.

# ML Model

Store Layout Optimization

-Feature Engineering: Include features such as product type, shelf location, proximity to high-traffic areas, and customer demographics.

-Model Selection: Use logistic regression or classification models (e.g., decision trees or random forests) to predict the likelihood of purchase based on product placement.

-Optimization: Use results to identify the most effective placements and simulate rearrangements to maximize purchases.

Estimating Revenue from Discounts

-Feature Engineering: Incorporate features like discount percentage, time of year, product demand elasticity, and competitor pricing.

-Model Selection: Use linear regression or ensemble models (e.g., gradient boosting) to predict sales volume and total revenue based on discount levels.

-Forecasting: Predict revenue scenarios for different discount strategies and identify the optimal discount levels to balance profitability and customer engagement.

# Explanation of the leveraged data format

For Store Layout Optimization:

-Data includes product ID, store section (e.g., checkout or aisle), customer traffic, number of sales, time frame (e.g., week/month), and customer demographics.

-Example: A dataset row might show a product placed in the front aisle with 500 customers passing by, leading to 50 purchases in one week.

For Revenue from Discounts:

-Data includes product ID, discount percentage, sales volume, total revenue, time of sale (e.g., weekday or weekend), and season (e.g., holiday).

-Example: A dataset row might show a 20% discount on a product during a holiday season, selling 200 units and generating $2,000.

# Visualizations 

Store Layout Optimization:

1. Heatmaps: Highlight high-traffic areas in the store.
Example: Show which store sections get the most foot traffic.

2. Bar Charts: Compare sales in different store sections.
Example: Display which zones sell the most products.

3. Scatter Plots: Show the relationship between customer traffic and sales.
Example: Prove whether high traffic increases purchases.

Revenue from Discounts:

1. Line Graphs: Show how sales change with discounts.
Example: Find the best discount for maximum sales.

2. Box Plots: Display sales data across different discount levels.
Example: Spot products that perform unusually well during discounts.

3. Stacked Bar Charts: Compare revenue by discount for product categories.
Example: See which categories benefit most from discounts.

# Description of what constitutes a successfully implemented product

We aim to create a dynamic store layout, paired with a year-long sales and discount timeline, to optimize product placement and drive performance throughout the year.

-Accurate Insights: Reliable predictions for optimizing product placement and discount strategies.

-User-Friendly: Clear dashboards and visualizations for easy decision-making.

-Scalable: Adapts to different store sizes, products, and seasons.

-Measurable Impact: Boosts sales, revenue, or profit margins with clear KPIs.

-Continuous Improvement: Updates models and strategies with new data for better results.

Example: A 15% sales increase from optimized layouts or a 10% revenue boost from smarter discounts.
